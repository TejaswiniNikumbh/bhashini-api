# bhashini-api
The project focuses on building a end to end text-to-speech (TTS) system using the LLM Models provided by
Bhashini and ULCA for language processing.The system accepts Hindi text input and generates corresponding speech output through a pipeline architecture.
Primary technologies includes Python for scripting, requests library for HTTP requests, base64 for audio
data encoding, and the wave module for WAV audio files.The code converts the text from Hindi to Punjabi and after translating it returns an audio file with Punjabi
translated audio.
